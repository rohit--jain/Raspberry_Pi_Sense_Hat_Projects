# Raspberry_Pi_Sense_Hat_Projects

This repository is for experiments with Raspbbery Pi's Official Sense HAT

Hardware Setup has Raspberry Pi Zero W v1.1 with right angled arrangement with Sense HAT

It was another creative soldering project with WaveShare's Pi400 GPIO Header Extension used actually with Pi Zero.

Previous idea was for fixing Pi Zero directly to Breadboard with Cobbler without need for Ribbon Cable to save Table Dsk Workspace, however it was ultimately never used.
